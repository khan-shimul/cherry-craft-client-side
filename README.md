# Cheer Craft

Here is my live project [Cheer Craft](https://skyline-estates.web.app/).

## About this project:

Cheer Craft is a Art & Craft related website.

* This is a react.js Web Application. I used Firebase (for authentication), MongoDB(for database), Tailwind Css, Daisy Ui, React Router and Some animation packages.
* In this website user can able to sign in and sign up. All the craft items come from database that displaying on the application.
* With this application user can able to add craft items, update craft items and also can be delete.
* A user can see all the arts & crafts he/she has added. Here a user
can only see his/her added data, but he/she can not access other's data.
* Implement Redirect uri (user friendly).

## NPM Package

* React Helmet
* AOS Package
* Animate CSS
* Swiper Slider
* React Simple Typewriter
* React Awesome Reveal

I have to improve my design. However, i'll add more feature in the future.
